# Medical Informatics Class Project
The aim of the system, structured as a database, is to collect information about the pathway of the
patients with heart failure and to keep track of the physiological changes for the parameters evaluated
at-home and in-hospital.
Some of them are collected in both environments but the primary goal is to assess and classify some
indices, to allow a constant activity of monitoring, improving the transmission of information between
the patient and the doctor.
